# Dotfiles

My humble dotfiles

Just clone and setup with

``` shell
git clone git@github.com:rafadc/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
make install
```

Remember to configure your shell as a login shell. In most linux distributions the shell is not like that by default.

## NVim

My vimfiles are also here to keep everythin gon the same repo

## Post configuration

My favourite font, Comic Code, is not free so you need to download it from https://www.myfonts.com
