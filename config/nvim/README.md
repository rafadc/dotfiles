# Vim

Tiny Vim config. It is still early stages since I am no power user at all.

Features:

- Telescope with smart file ordering
- Arrow for marking files
- Spectre for search and replace

## Building

We are using oxi for Spectre search and replace so you need to

```
cd ~/.local/share/nvim/lazy/nvim-spectre
./build.sh
